# String Checker Assignment

In this assignment, you'll be writing three methods to carry out some String operations. Using the Java String methods will be very helpful. Furthermore, you will likely want to use a for loop to loop through your Strings, such as:

```shell
String str = "hello";
for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
    System.out.println(str.charAt(i));
}
```

Add code to [MyMain.java](src/main/java/MyMain.java) to implement the above methods.

## Run your code with:
The easiest way to run your code is to press the play button in [MyMain.java](src/main/java/MyMain.java).

However, you can also run your code by typing the following into the Terminal.

```shell script
make run
```

Alternatively, if that doesn't work, use:

```shell script
./gradlew run
```

## Run your tests with:
The easiest way to run your code is to press the play button in [MyTests.java](src/test/java/MyTests.java).

However, you can also run your code by typing the following into the Terminal.

```shell script
make test
```

Alternatively, if that doesn't work, use:

```shell script
./gradlew test
```
